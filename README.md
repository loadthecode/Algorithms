This mini-project consists of several algorithms, including sorting, searching and other popular ones. Algorithms that fall into a similar
category are subclasses of an interface (ex. Sorting, Searching) and are referenced from within the Algorithms class. 

This is implemented using the Strategy Design Pattern. This allows us to change the strategy (ex. merge sort, quick sort, etc.) at runtime.
